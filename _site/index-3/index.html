		    <h3>IOC 7 Day Coding Challenge</h3>
		    <p>The 7 Day Coding Challenge is officially closed. It’s been such a pleasure to share our joy of coding with so many people from all over the world and humbling to hear first hand how much you have enjoyed it. </p>

<p>If you have found this free challenge valuable we would be so grateful if you would consider leaving us a review on <a href="http://facebook.com/instituteofcode" target="_blank">our facebook page</a> with feedback for the free mini coding course.</p>

<p>We would also welcome and constructive feedback you have about how we can make this course even better in future. This was our first time running an online program of this scale, and there have been lots of little lessons along the way but we’re always open to hearing your thoughts and feedback via <a href="mailto:hello@instituteofcode.com?subject=Feedback%20on%20Coding%20Challenge">email</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/instituteofcode" target="_blank">DM</a>. </p>

<p>Who would have thought that in only 7 days worth of lessons you could go from zero to building real projects like these…</p>

<h2 id="our-website-in-a-weekend-online-course">Our Website in a Weekend Online Course </h2>

<p>We’ve had so many questions about <a href="https://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev-101/" target="_blank">our online course</a>, that we wanted to jump in and answer them here! </p>

<p><strong>1. What does this cover that we haven’t already learnt? </strong></p>

<p>It digs deeper into HTML &amp; CSS, including more advanced styling, and making your website responsive (adapt to mobile and tablet devices). By the end of the course you’ll have the skills and resources to build a complete website from scratch. </p>

<p><strong>2. What kind of website will you be able to build? </strong><br /><br />At the moment there is one single-page web site template included (more advanced than what you have built currently) and in-depth tutorials allowing you to go beyond this. <br /><br />Over the next two months we’re adding dozens of new tutorials, additional templates AND these modular website templates – building blocks of HTML &amp; CSS that you can copy + paste + customise to build a brand new website in no time. </p>

<p><img src="/uploads/screen-recording-2020-01-21-at-1-45-53-pm.gif" alt="" width="1280" height="698" /></p>

<p>If you enroll in the course now, you’ll receive access to all future updates and tutorials at no additional cost. </p>

<p><strong>3. How much does Website in a Weekend cost? </strong><br /><br />As soon as we release the additional tutorials mentioned above the price will be increasing to $450. It’s currently $250, and we’re giving all 7 day coding challenge participants a coupon ‘<a href="https://ioc.podia.com/web-dev-101?coupon=7DAYCODING" target="_blank">7DAYCODING</a>’ to receive $100 off for the next two weeks only. <br /><br />If you decide to attend the bootcamp later, we’ll credit the amount you spend on Website in a Weekend towards the bootcamp tuition. </p>

<p><strong>4. What kind of support is provided? </strong></p>

<p>We have a private facebook community that is monitored by our experienced mentors where we can help answer your questions and provide technical support.</p>

<p>If you would like one-on-one skype access to our experienced mentors, we can provide packs of 4 hours of support for only $100 (one-on-one support from an experienced developer is normally at least $60 per hour). </p>

<p><strong>5. What if I’m not satisfied with the course? </strong></p>

<p>We believe whole heartedly in our so far have a 100% satisfaction from everyone who has completed the course.  Contact us within two weeks of purchase and explain how the program did not meet your expectations for a full refund. </p>

<h2 id="our-hybrid-bootcamp-in-bali">Our Hybrid Bootcamp in Bali</h2>

<p>Looking to take things to the next level? Our <a href="http://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev" target="_blank">hybrid bootcamp</a> (6 weeks part time online + 10 day intensive in Bali + lifetime support) might be exactly what you need. </p>

<p>This program goes well beyond the basics and teaches you how to build a freelance career as a web developer (or land a job at an agency if that’s more your thing). </p>

<p><strong>A few highlights in the curriculum: </strong><br />- learning how to use jQuery (a library for Javascript) to add interactive elements like pop-up lightbox galleries, sliders / carousels, hamburger mobile menus etc. <br />- how to create dynamic layouts for things like blog posts or project pages<br />- how to create smooth animations on hover and other transitions <br />- how to add live chat widget<br />- how to add custom contact forms that sync with a CRM like Hubspot<br />- how to create advanced layouts with overlapping elements (like the IOC website)<br />- how to optimise your website for performance in every browser and on mobile devices </p>

<p>Check out our <a href="http://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev" target="_blank">course page</a> for all the details and examples of student projects! <br /><br />The main difference though between an online course and in-person immersive is in the practical experience – it’s one thing to understand the theory of specific properties; It’s another thing completely to build an entire website from scratch. We focus in the bootcamp on taking the skills you have learnt in the video modules and applying them, building things and breaking things, learning how to troubleshoot and write efficient code. So that by the time you finish the program you can confidently build website for yourself or clients, from start to finish. </p>

<p><img src="/images/21544120_1619366984782168_8914572262766507567_o.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" /><br /><br />We also cover how to take these skills and build them into a business, including how to find build an effective portfolio, find and pitch to clients, scope and price projects etc. We give our students everything they need to hit the ground running and start working on real client projects – and it’s not uncommon for students to land their first paying client less than one month after the bootcamp. </p>

<p><img src="/uploads/ioc-44.jpg" alt="" width="1333" height="2000" /></p>

<p>Oh, and it doesn’t hurt that our program is all-inclusive in this beautiful villa in Bali complete with chef prepared meals and daily yoga to help you get into the flow state ideal for learning. </p>

<p><img src="/uploads/ioc-6.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>

<p>Thinking about attending the bootcamp? We’ve put aside 2x $500 partial scholarships for those of you who have putting in the hard work and dedication to completing this 7 day challenge. For more details and your chance to receive one of these scholarships <a href="http://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev" target="_blank">apply via our website mentioning this</a> and then <a href="http://www.calendly.com/ioc" target="_blank">book a call to chat</a> with our course advisor Terry or co-founder Tina.</p>
