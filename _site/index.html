				<h2>IOC Pre-Coursework</h2>
				<h3>Welcome to IOC</h3>
			</div>
			<article class="content">
				<p>We’re so excited that you’ll be joining us on our 10 day coding retreat. <strong>We’ve structured this program to help you really make the most of your time</strong> – by learning tangible, practical skills fast.</p>

<p>To maximize your time and your learning, we use a hybrid model of online and in-person learning. First, we take all of the content that can be condensed into a tradition lesson and create bite-sized video tutorials to share the basics of every topic. You can do this at your own pace, re-watch videos that you need a bit of repetition on and if you need more direct support you can always reach out to our team. It should take you around 15 - 25 hours to complete the pre-coursework, depending on how much time you spend planning your portfolio and practicing the skills.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/versions/villa-2---x----1200-800x---.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This pre-coursework will help you to familiarize yourself with some of the broader ideas and terminology and will make learning on the course that much easier. There are a few sections, with a few videos and activities in each – it won’t take long to get through it, but if you can we recommend watching the videos twice. Once a few weeks before, and once in the week leading up to the retreat.</p>

<p>Then on the retreat, we’ll focus on taking these patches of theoretical knowledge and building real skills. We’ll teach you <strong>how to confidently build a real site from scratch</strong>, how to create reusable code that makes you faster and more efficient (saving you time and money!).</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/versions/villa-6-copy---x----800-600x---.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We’ll train you in the valuable skill of troubleshooting and you’ll learn directly from experienced mentors how to figure out why a website is ‘broken’ and how to quickly identify the problem and fix it yourself. We’ll teach you industry best practices that if you ever want to work in a creative agency, corporate environment, or with other developers will give you a competitive edge. We’re going to give you the skills and the confidence to start building responsive websites from scratch, not pass some arbitrary test.</p>

<h2 id="our-teaching-philosophy">Our Teaching Philosophy</h2>

<p>We believe that you learn best when you are ‘getting your hands dirty’ so unlike most courses, you won’t be spending all of your time sitting in lectures being talked at. For each module of content, we’ll have at most a 15 - 20 minute presentation, usually where one of the mentors is coding live on the screen and talking you through why something works the way it does and how it applies in <strong>real projects.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/versions/villa-7---x----1200-800x---.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>On this course, you’ll be mostly <strong>learning from doing</strong>, building websites, breaking them and learning first hand how to fix them and avoid those problems in the future. I’ve tried to condense what took me (and many other self-taught developers) months of trial and error into a 10 day intensive course.</p>

<p>We know that everyone has a different learning style, so we cater to that by providing a rich variety of materials. We have waterproof flash cards for you to practice key concepts in the pool, video lessons to refresh that days’ lessons, and extensive lesson notes with real code examples that you can play with. We also have 3-4 experienced mentors on hand at all times to help you if you are stuck or just want to explore something more deeply.</p>

<p>I guarantee this course will be different to anything you have ever experienced before.</p>

<h2 id="getting-you-in-the-flow-state">Getting you in the ‘Flow’ State</h2>

<p>When people first hear about our concept, learning to code in an all-inclusive retreat environment, there can sometimes be a bit of skepticism - feeling like the concept is ‘gimmicky’ and that we’re just making coding bootcamp into a cushy experience.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/versions/instagram036-7103---x----1200-800x---.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/villa-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We get that – if you are innovating a stagnant industry, there is always going to be some kickback. Lots of experts said that we would never go to the moon, that personal computers would never gain traction, or that nobody would ever want to buy a smartphone.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing. When we created Institute of Code, we tried to forget everything we knew about what a school was and re-imagine what a school could be. We dove deep into <strong>educational psychology, motivation, and mindset</strong> as well as drawing on our own experience looking to create an environment that get’s you in that flow state – the one where you feel motivated, and focused and inspired and you power through content faster than you ever thought possible.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/versions/villa-3---x----1000-667x---.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Every single decision we’ve made is around this goal – how can we create an environment that sets people up for success and helps them develop tangible skills fast while creating an experience that they will cherish forever.</p>

<p>And based on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1129328283786043.1073741837.950588074993399&amp;type=3">feedback we’ve been getting from past students</a>, it seems to be working!</p>

<p>This pre-coursework is to help prepare you for your upcoming course, and cover some of the basics. Make sure you allocate the time to not only watch the videos but complete all of the practical activities and plan your portfolio before the course begins.</p>
