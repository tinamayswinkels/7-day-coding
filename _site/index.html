		        <p><em>A message from our founders… </em></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/ioc-internal-4784.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>

<p>It’s an idea that’s pretty ingrained it our society that assumes misery and discomfort must be more effective than anything fun. We glorify people who work 100 hours per week, and assume that hard work and enjoyment are mutually exclusive — we work hard now so that we can have fun later, when we retire. We’ve built our program from the ground up not by looking at the way things have always been done, but by digging deep into educational psychology, motivation and high performance. We tried to forget everything we knew about what a school was and reimagine what a school could be.</p>

<p>We know that when people are in their ‘flow’ state — when they are inspired, motivated, supported and eager to learn, they can accomplish so much more than they would in a normal day. So we set out to create an environment that helped get people into a state of mind that fosters accelerated learning.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/ioc-5.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>

<p>Our program doesn’t have chef prepared meals, daily yoga and meditation, and beautiful surroundings just for the sake of ‘infuriating’ people, or because it makes for an incredible experience (although that’s definitely a perk). We do it because when you remove people from the distractions of everyday life, keep them nourished with high quality food, movement and meditation, and when you give them a beautiful natural environment to surround themselves with while they learn, something amazing happens…</p>

<p>People learn very fast.</p>

<p>It just makes sense when you think about it. We take away all of the mental distractions (cooking, cleaning, commuting, miscellaneous chores) so that people can focus on just one thing — learning to code, surrounded by other professionals, entrepreneurs and creatives in an environment that inspires them.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/ioc-14.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>

<p>Sure, a beautiful environment alone isn’t enough to help people build digital skills fast. You also need to have a comprehensive course, that is grounded in practical code challenges not just memorising syntax; experienced mentors who are engaged with their students and love their job (and when they are living in a beautiful pool villa with all the above mentioned perks, that part comes pretty easy) and who are willing to support and nurture people’s skills long after the course has ended. But once you’ve done all those things, these little extras really take things to the next level.</p>

<p>To thrive in this digital world we’re going to need to work hard, learn new skills, and adapt to change… why not do it in an environment that’s backed by science and blissfully enjoyable.</p>

<p>The final thing that this structure creates is an environment that is inclusive to everyone. We’re trying to tackle head on the gender and diversity gap in tech, through a variety of specific initiatives like providing partial scholarships for women and anyone who has faced personal hardship, as well as the culture at our company. There’s a lot to be gained from spreading tech skills and knowledge beyond the exclusive (and predominately white male) group who’s holding on so tight to it now. We’re proud of the fact that 80% of our students so far have been female, and when you compare that against the broader statistics we know we’re doing something right.</p>

<p>- Emilio &amp; Tina, Co-Founders of Institute of Code</p>

<h2 id="what-we-do-at-institute-of-code">What we do at Institute of Code</h2>

<p>Our hybrid program takes them from zero previous experience to profitable business in two months through 6 weeks self-paced online (with mentor support of course) and then a 10-day immersive bootcamp in Bali. We take our students away from the stress and distractions of everyday life, to an environment dedicated to helping them thrive at our campus in Bali - with daily yoga, an in-house chef team, beautiful learning environment and more.</p>

<p>And because we are passionate about seeing them succeed we provide lifetime technical and career support on the skills they have learnt.</p>

<h2 id="our-hybrid-model">Our Hybrid Model</h2>

<p>The best combination of online and in-person learning to help you launch a completely new career in less than 2 months.</p>

<h4 id="self-paced-online-pre-coursework">Self-Paced Online Pre-Coursework</h4>

<p>We’ve put together a comprehensive curriculum of video tutorials and practical activities to kickstart your learning, all from the comfort of your own home.</p>

<p>Our mentors will be available on-demand to support you every step of the way. This portion of the course is self-paced, so you can complete it spread over 6 weeks part-time (around 3 hours per week) or squeeze it all into one long weekend.</p>

<h4 id="10-day-intensive-in-bali">10-day Intensive in Bali</h4>

<p>At the in-person bootcamp you’ll take your skills to the next level with more advanced lessons, practical workshops and case studies and learn how to build a thriving new business.</p>

<p>Our program is all-inclusive, so that from the moment you touch down you can focus on learning. And with a 1-4 mentor ratio, you’ll get all the one-on-one attention you need to kickstart your new career and build a global community of peers.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/ioc-45.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" /></p>

<h4 id="lifetime-support">Lifetime Support</h4>

<p>We provide all of our students with unlimited lifetime technical and career support – yep, you read that right. We believe that once you attend one our programs you are part of the IOC family for life, and we’ll be there every step of the way.</p>

<p>Whether you need help with a website you built or a campaign you are running, need help pitching to a client or landing your dream job or want advice on how to manage your ever growing client list we’ve got your back.</p>

<h4 id="learn-from-experts-in-the-field-with-4-instructors-and-only-16-students">Learn from experts in the field, with 4 instructors and only 16 students</h4>

<p>Our courses are built and taught by experts in the field who have built real thriving businesses in their field. We go way beyond the theoretical advice you’ll find in a textbook or other online courses into the strategies, workflows and tools that will help you take your career to the next level.</p>

<p>We consolidate as much of that knowledge as possible into our comprehensive online resources and then work side-by-side in small groups helping you go from little-to-no previous experience to a new career in less than two months.</p>

<h3 id="getting-you-in-the-flow-state-with-our-accelerated-learning-environment">Getting you in the flow state with our accelerated learning environment</h3>

<p>When you arrive at our villa in Bali, you’ll immediately understand how we’re different – we take our students away from the stress and distractions of everyday life and take care of every little detail so that you can focus on one thing - learning.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/ioc-5dm49212.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1066" /></p>

<p>From the beautiful environment of our campus, to the chef prepared meals and the one-to-four mentor ratio every decision we make is based around how we can create the best possible environment for learning.</p>
