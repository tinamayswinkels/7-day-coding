Browser: Chrome We’ll be using Chrome to preview and test our websites, as it has the best developer tools. Download the latest version of Google Chrome Online Code Editor: CodePen Next you will need a CodePen account. CodePen is a great site for testing code when you don’t want to set up a folder and files for tiny snippets of code. Go to http: codepen.io and click on the Sign Up button on the top right corner. Scroll to the Free Plan and Sign Up. We’ll be using codepen regularly to learn new coding concepts or play with ideas straight from the browser. Code Editor: Atom Go to https: atom.io download the latest version. Atom is the code editor that we are using to write code and build your website projects. You can write code in any text editor (even simple applications like text-edit) but code editors like Atom have additional functionality that makes web development easier, like code hints and color coding the syntax. Design Tool: Adobe Experience Design Download Adobe Experience Design (it’s free!). This is a great tool to create wireframes or mockups of your portfolio website. We will be sending you the template for the first website you will be creating in Adobe Experience Design if you want to experiment with the colors and fonts. Github Github is a version control tool – it allows us to save every version of our websites, review past changes, etc. Head to Github.com and create a free account and download Github Desktop. FOR MAC USERS – Make sure your Mac OS is running one of the last 3 versions (OS X Sierra, Mojave or Catalina) and if it isn’t update it here."

						"category": "",
						"url": " /a-Intro-to-Coding/2.%20intro-to-coding/",
						"content": "Code is just a set of instructions written in a language that computers can understand. When we write code, we’re literally just writing a text document with a specific combination of characters and symbols (like punctuation). We’ll be learning coding languages which include HTML, CSS and Javascript. A website is made up of a collection of these text files (some written in HTML, some written in CSS and possibly some written in Javascript) and assets like images all stored within a folder. During the course, you’ll be writing code in HTML, CSS and Javascript which the browser will interpret and ‘draw’ into a beautiful interactive website. Key Takeaways Front-end vs Back-end Front-end development deals with the part of the web you can see and interact with – the user interface of websites and apps. Frontend development always includes HTML &amp; CSS and sometimes Javascript. Web-Development is a subset of Front-end development that just deals with how to built websites. Back-end development deals with the part of a website or app that you can’t see – that interacts with the database or server, powers apps etc. Many simple websites don’t need a backend at all, but complex sites like e-commerce stores, Netflix, Google, etc all have a backend powering their functionality. Languages, Libraries &amp; Frameworks At the top level we have programming languages – things like HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, etc. Each language has it’s own syntax and semantics (it’s vocabulary and patterns of usage that allow it to make sense). HTML controls the structure of web-pages. We use HTML to add headings, paragraphs, links, images, sections etc to our website. CSS controls the style of the website, by applying colors, fonts, positioning, etc to the HTML elements. Javascript adds interactivity to your website. If you have a slider, or pop-up or FAQs that drop-down these were likely controlled Javascript. Below programming languages we have libraries and frameworks. These are sets of pre-written code that allow us to code in that particular programming language faster. jQuery for example is a library for javascript that takes many of the common tasks someone would want to accomplish with javascript (like showing and hiding content) and does the hard work for you – you can just write shorthand jQuery and it will utilise the pre-written code to speedup your workflow. Imagine it kind of like building a desk – the programming languages are the raw materials, timber, steel, plastic etc. But the libraries and frameworks are pre-built components like table-legs and table-top that you can quickly assemble together. You may have heard of Angular, React, jQuery, Vue.js … these are some of the most popular libraries for Javascript. jQuery is great for adding simple functionality to websites, while the others can be used to create interactive interfaces for complex web apps. Likewise Bootstrap, Foundation &amp; Materialize, are all libraries for HTML &amp; CSS that have a set of pre-written code to allow you to quickly build common elements (like say a button or a contact form). For example, by using one of these libraries to create a button you could just use built-in classes like ‘button’ and it would pull in pre-written css styles to make that link look and feel like a button. Many sites also then have a CMS or Content Management System, like Wordpress, Joomla, CloudCannon, etc. Content management systems are a piece of software that sits between an end user and the code files and allows non-technical users to make changes to the content of the website without knowing how to code. When someone says they have a ‘wordpress website’ they mean that they have a site that’s built in HTML, CSS &amp; javascript but integrated into the wordpress content management system using PHP (the programming language that wordpress uses). Because Wordpress has a specific way that it likes the code to be written you can’t always take a Wordpress website and move it away from Wordpress even though it also uses HTML &amp; CSS."

						"category": "",
						"url": " /b-hello-html/1.%20intro-to-html/",
						"content": "While getting started with HTML, you will likely encounter new—and often strange—terms. Over time you will become more and more familiar with all of them, but the three common HTML terms you should begin with are elements, tags, and attributes. Elements &amp; Tags Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. Some of the more frequently used elements include multiple levels of headings (identified as &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; elements) and paragraphs (identified as the &lt;p&gt; element); the list goes on to include the &lt;a&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;div&gt; and &lt;nav&gt; elements, and many more. The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a tag. Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags. An opening tag marks the beginning of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by an element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, &lt;div&gt;. A closing tag marks the end of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by a forward slash and the element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, &lt; div&gt;. The content that falls between the opening and closing tags is the content of that element. A paragraph, for example, will have an opening tag of &lt;p&gt; and a closing tag of &lt; p&gt;. What falls between these two tags will be the content of the paragraph. So, a paragraph element is created with an opening tag, some content and a closing tag. &lt;p&gt; ... &lt; p&gt; Throughout this document wherever you see the dots used in a code example ( … ) this is simply a placeholder for additional code which is left out to keep the example focused on the main point. Common HTML Elements &lt;h1&gt; This is a level 1 heading &lt; h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt; This is a level 2 heading &lt; h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt; This is a level 3 heading &lt;h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph &lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=\" logo.png\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http: www.url.com\"&gt; This is a link &lt;a&gt; Attributes Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element to the browser. &lt;element attribute-name=\"attribute-value\"&gt; ... &lt; element&gt; When we create a link, if we just wrote &lt;a&gt; click me &lt; a&gt; the browser would know that we had created a link, but wouldn’t know where to send it. For example, this is an&lt;a&gt; element with a href (short for hyperlink reference) attribute. This code will take users to http: www.google.com when they click the “Click here to go to google” text. &lt;a href=\"http: www.google.com \"&gt; Click here to go to google. &lt; a&gt; Images also need an attribute to tell them where to find the source image. In the example below, the image element displays an image that you have uploaded into your website folder called ‘logo.png’ with the alternate text (for slow loading devices, visually impaired and SEO) of ‘Website Logo’ to describe the image. &lt;img src=\" logo.png\" alt=\"Website Logo\"&gt; There are two kinds of images you can add with HTML, images that are hosted on your own website (like the one above) and images that are hosted elsewhere where you would use a full url (for example http: www.website.com images photo.png) as the source.  Some attributes are required for that element to function (like the src attribute for images or the href attribute for links) while others are optional, like the class or id attribute (we’ll learn more about what they do later). We can add a class to just about any element, such as a h2 heading. &lt;h2 class=“featured”&gt; This is a heading &lt; h2&gt; There is no limit on how many attributes one element can have.  &lt;a href=\" form.html\" class=“button” id=\"apply\"&gt; Apply Now &lt; a&gt; Self-Closing Elements In the previous example, the &lt;img&gt; element had only an opening tag and didn’t include a closing tag. Fear not, this was intentional. Not all elements consist of opening and closing tags. Some elements simply receive their content or behaviour from attributes within a single tag. The &lt;img&gt; element is one of these elements. The content of the previous &lt;img&gt; element is assigned with the use of the source attribute and value. Common self-closing elements include: &lt;img&gt; &lt;link&gt; &lt;embed&gt; &lt;meta&gt; Nesting Elements We organise and structure our HTML document in two ways – through the order, from top to bottom, and by nesting elements inside other elements. The easiest way to think about it is that each HTML element is like a basket that can hold content, other baskets or both. In this example we start with a&lt;html&gt; element, and within this there is a &lt;head&gt; element and a &lt;body&gt; element. Nested inside the head element we have a &lt;title&gt; element and nested within the&lt;body&gt; element is a &lt;header&gt; element, a couple of &lt;section&gt; elements and a &lt;footer&gt; element, and so on. Then inside the header element we have a h1 and a nav. &lt;html&gt; &lt;!-- This is the head --&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; This is my Website Title &lt; title&gt; &lt; head&gt; &lt;!-- This is the body --&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;h1&gt; Hello World &lt; h1&gt; &lt;nav&gt; ... &lt; nav&gt; &lt; header&gt; &lt;section&gt; ... &lt; section&gt; &lt;section&gt; ...&lt; section&gt; &lt;footer&gt; ... &lt; footer&gt; &lt; body&gt; &lt; html&gt; Any element that is nested inside another is considered a ‘child’ of that element. So the h1 is a child of the header, and then body is the parent of the footer. This structure becomes important later on when we are styling the document. All elements that are inside the body element, that is between it’s open tag and close tag are considered descendents (the children, grandchildren, etc.) It’s important that you tab in each level of descendent to make it easy to understand the hierarchy. Review Questions Before you arrive you should be able to answer these questions off the top of your head. Try looking away from your notes and testing yourself. How do you create a paragraph? How about a H1 heading, or a h3 heading? Write the code to create an image (hint, it’s hosted at http: website.com logo.jpg) Write the code to create an anchor link that says ‘Click Me’ and goes to www.instituteofcode.com What is an attribute? Where do you put at attribute within a html element? Which elements ‘self-close’?"

						"id": "b-hello-html-2-html-links",
						"title": "HTML Links",
						"category": "",
						"url": " /b-hello-html/2.html-links/",
						"content": "Basic Links The simplest form of a link is: html &lt;a href=\" about.html\"&gt; About &lt; a&gt; In the example above we have created a text link, but you can actually wrap any html element in a link. For example, this will create a link around an image, so that when you click on the image you will navigate to the about page. &lt;a href=\" about.html\"&gt; &lt;img src=\" images photo.jpg\"&gt; &lt; a&gt; You can even wrap whole sections in a link. This is quite common for say a blog post excerpt where you want someone to be able to click on any part in order to go to the blog post. In this way it’s functioning kind of like a container element (which we’ll learn about soon) as well as a link. &lt;a href=\" about.html\"&gt; &lt;img src=\" images photo.jpg\"&gt; &lt;h3&gt; My Blog Post &lt; h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a short description of my blog post &lt; p&gt; &lt; a&gt; Linking to an Email Address When we add an email address to the page, we often want to make it easier on the user by allowing them to click to send an email. To create an email link that will open a new message in the person’s default mail client we just need to create an &lt;a&gt; link where the href attribute value starts with mailto: &lt;a href=\"mailto:tina@instituteofcode.com\"&gt;Email me&lt; a&gt; To populate the subject field, we just add ?subject= after the email address. The question mark binds the first new parameter to the hyperlink path. To add an additional parameter, we just use an ampersand &amp; to add an additional parameter. For example, lets create a link that sends an email to tina@instituteofcode.com with a subject line of ‘Hello friend’ and a body of ‘How are you?**‘. We can’t have spaces in links, so we need to encode the space by using the phrase ‘%20’ &lt;a href=\"mailto:tina@instituteofcode.com?subject=Hello%20friend&amp;body=How%20are%20you?\"&gt;Email me&lt; a&gt; That can be time consuming so if you have a long subject or message you can always use a mailto link generator. Making a link open in a new tab There is an attribute called ‘target’. If you set it to target=\"_blank\" your links will then to open the link in a new tab. This link below would open google in a new tab. &lt;a href=\"http: www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt; Email me &lt; a&gt; Linking to other sections on the page Normal links always go to the top of the page, but what if we wanted to link to a specific section of the page? Using anchor links we can take someone to a specific point on a specific page. To create this we need a link which points to an anchor, and the anchor itself (an element with an id). To do this we would create an id attribute on the element that we wanted to link to (ie a section, div or heading perhaps). After doing this, you can create a link that points to this anchor by using the # symbol in from of the anchor name. To navigate to an anchor on the same page you would just write something like this and it would take you to the section of the page with an id of services (&lt;section id=\"services\"&gt;) &lt;a href=\"#services\"&gt;Services&lt; a&gt; And if you wanted to link to an anchor on another page you would use the full URL like this: &lt;a href=\" about#services\"&gt;Go to the services section on the about page&lt; a&gt; See the Pen Anchor Links by The Institute of Code (@instituteofcode) on CodePen. How do you create a button?  This is kind of a trick question, because buttons are just normal anchor links that have been styled by css to look like a link. While there is actually a &lt;button&gt; element that you might stumble upon, that actually has a different purpose all together so stick to anchor links for now.  Common practice is to create a class of ‘button’ to style all of the links that you want to look like buttons.  &lt;a href=\" about\" class=\"button\"&gt;CLICK ME&lt; a&gt; Linking to files (like downloadable PDFs) It’s actually really easy to let people download a PDF, Mp3 etc from your site just using a normal link. All you have to do is first add the file to your website folder, and then link to it just like it were an image or a page.  &lt;a href=\" media-kit.pdf\" class=\"button\"&gt;DOWNLOAD MEDIA KIT&lt; a&gt;"

A selector designates exactly which element or elements within our HTML to target and apply styles to (such as color, size, and position). The most basic form of selectors target the type of element, such as &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;p&gt;. CSS is made up of selectors, properties and values. selector { property: value; } Within CSS, selectors are followed with curly brackets, { }, which encompass the styles to be applied to the selected element. Below is an example of a p selector that would apply the styles listed within the curly brackets to all paragraphs on the page. p {...} Once an element is selected, a property determines the styles that will be applied to that element. Property names fall after a selector, within the curly brackets, { }, and immediately preceding a colon, :. There are numerous properties we can use, such as background, color, font-size, height, and width. Here we are selecting all &lt;p&gt; elements and setting the value of the (font) color property to be blue and the value of the font-size property to be 16 pixels (px). p { color: blue; font-size: 16px; } Each property has particular units of values that it will accept. For example, the value or a color property can be a common color name (like red, blue or green) or a hex code (#FEFEFE) or an rgb value ( rgb(60,60,60) ). It is a common practice to indent property and value pairs within the curly brackets. As with HTML, these indentations help keep our code organized and legible."

Colors can be set using color names (blue, green, yellow), hex codes (#FFF), rgb values (rgb(60,60,65)) or rgba values which are like rgb values but also have an ‘alpha’ value which determines the transparency (rgba(60,60,65,0.5)). Eg. This will set the color of all of the paragraphs to red. p { color: red; } The font-family property sets the font of the text. By default there are around 15 fonts that are available by default in every browser, including ‘Arial’, ‘Helvetica’ and ‘Georgia’ and ‘Courier New’. More often than not though, we will use a more attractive font that is hosted by google – aka a ‘Google Font’. We’ll learn how to add google font’s during the retreat, but for now just have a look at the google fonts and see how many there are! If you are using a web-font, then you should specify a ‘fall-back’ font for it to use in case the web-font doesn’t load. Options include Serif, Sans-Serif, and Script. Eg. This will set the font of all h1 headings to Courier New. h1 { font-family: 'Courier New', sans-serif; } The font-weight property sets the thickness of the font. Depending on your font, the options available may just be normal and bold, or you may have up to 8 variations (100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800). Eg. This sets all paragraphs to be bold. p { font-weight: bold;} The text-align property sets the way that the text flows on the page, it can be left aligned, right aligned, center aligned or justified. Eg. This will align the body (ie the whole page) to the center. body { text-align: center;} The text-decoration property determines any ‘decorations’ on the text like underline. You will notice that links are underlined by default, so if you want to remove the underline you would need to set the text decoration to none. Eg. This removes the underline from all links and instead makes them bold. a { text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; }   LINK TO SLIDES  "

Eg. This adds 10% padding within the element and 5% margin outside of the element with a teal background color so that you can see the difference. body { background-color: #1abc9c; padding: 10%; margin: 5%; } In this example, we have a h1 element that says hello world. The space between the element and it’s border (in yellow) is padding, while the space outside of the pink border is the margin. This would be styled something like this:   Another way of thinking of it is that padding is like an elements body fat, it’s part of the element, while the margin is personal space around the element.

Preferrably for accessibility as it enables users to zoom text. If the html is set to 16px then 1rem would be 16px % Refers to a percentage of it’s parent container. Often used for creating layouts vw % of the viewport (screen) width vh % of the viewport (screen) height Which units to use: We’ll be using rems for typography For layouts (to control the size of elements or add padding and margin on container elements) we’ll typically use percentages or vw vh We’ll set border width in px &amp; border-radius in px or percentages For responsive typography that scales with the page (ie you want a big banner text that takes up half the page) we can use vw We won’t be using ems, but if you want to learn more about ems vs rems and when they might be useful check out this comprehensive article.  Summary Every element in web development is a rectangular box that consists of margin, border, padding, and the actual content text. Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear. Padding - Space around the element between it’s content and the border (the ) Border - A border that goes around the padding and content. Margin - Clears an area outside the border.

Borders The border property adds a border around the elements in question, and to do so you set a border width, style, and color in one property – {border: width style color;} Style values can include solid, dashed, dotted etc. You need all three parts to make a border work Eg. This sets a purple 1px wide border around everything with a class of button in a solid style. .button { border: 1px solid purple; } The border-radius property curves the corners of an element. A 3px border radius means the borders are curved 3px from the edge – the higher the number, the rounder the corner. You can use pixels or percentages for border radius, and if you set the value to at least 50% a square will become a circle (a rectangle will become an oval). Eg. This sets the corners of the buttons (and thus it’s border or background color) to be rounded. .button { border-radius: 5px; }"

						"content": "Working with Selectors So far we have used selectors that target types of HTML elements. But what if we want to style only certain headings or elements, or if we want to apply styling to a whole section of html elements? We can create selectors that target an attribute value (of the HTML element), such as an id or class value, or target the type of element, such as &lt;h1&gt; or &lt;p&gt;. Type or Element Selectors Type selectors target elements by their element type. For example, should we wish to target all division elements, &lt;div&gt;, we would use a type selector of div. The following code shows a type selector for div element as well as the corresponding HTML it selects. CSS: div { ... } HTML: &lt;div&gt;...&lt; div&gt; &lt;div&gt;...&lt; div&gt; CLASS SELECTORS When we want to apply the same styles to different elements at once, we use class selectors that target elements with the same class attribute. Class selectors are a little more specific than type selectors, as they select a particular group of elements rather than all elements of one type. Within CSS, class selectors start with a full-stop ‘.’ (or period as it’s known in America) followed by the class attribute value. Here the class selector will select any element containing the class attribute value of awesome, including the div element and the paragraph element. CSS: .awesome { ... } HTML: &lt;div class=\"awesome\"&gt;...&lt; div&gt; &lt;p class=\"awesome\"&gt;...&lt; p&gt; ID SELECTORS ID selectors are even more precise than class selectors, as they target only one single unique element at a time. Just like class selectors use an element’s class attribute value as the selector, ID selectors use an element’s id attribute value as a selector. Regardless of which type of element they appear on, id attribute values can only be used once per page. If you need to style more than one element, you need to use the class attribute and selector rather than the id. To select a specific element by its id we use the hash symbol, #, followed by the id attribute value. Here the id selector will only select the element containing the id attribute value of biglogo. CSS: #biglogo { ... } HTML: &lt;h1 id=\"biglogo\"&gt;...&lt; h1&gt;"

						"content": "Cascading Style Sheets So far we have looked at how to select elements and apply styles to them, but what if there are conflicting styles? For example if we set the body (which includes all elements) to have a color of red, and then set the &lt;h1&gt; to have a color of blue, what color will the &lt;h1&gt; be? Luckily when there is a conflict between instructions, CSS has rules to determine which styles to use and which to ignore. It determines in the following order: 1. It cascades from top to bottom Styles declared at the bottom of the stylesheet override styles at the top of the stylesheet. p { background: orange; font-size: 24px; } h1{ color: red; } p { background: green; } In this example, the paragraph elements would have a background color of green, because it comes below the background of orange and thus takes precedence in the cascade. The font size would remain 24px because there is no new font-size overriding it. This is also why we also list our own stylesheet last in the head of the html (below external stylesheets) – so that if there are conflicting styles, ours take precedent.  2. It cascades based on specificity. Every selector in CSS has a specificity weight. This, along with the placement in the cascade, identifies how styles will be rendered. The element type selector has the lowest specificity, then the class selector, then the ID selector. So a selector that selects a class will override one that selects an element type, and a selector that selects ID will override a conflicting one that selects based on class even if it comes later in the document. Classes are more specific than element names, and ids are more specific that classes. For some people it’s easier to understand specificity by looking at this calculator which will tell you the numerical specificity ‘value’ of each selector. In mathematical terms, an ID has a specificity of 100, a class attribute psuedo-class has a specificity of 10 and an element or pseudo-element has a specificity of 1.  So a selector that used two classes and an element selector (ie section .button.featured) would have a specificity weight of 21. Troubleshooting CSS Issues One of the most common css issues you will face is where you have two conflicting styles in your css and the one that you want to apply is being overridden by another. The best way to figure this out is to use the inspector. When you inspect element, in the styles panel you will see which styles are being applied to your element. Here are the three common issues and their solutions. Issue #1: Incorrect Selector If you haven’t used a correct selector (ie spelling mistake, missing a space or a full stop, etc) then you won’t see the style appear in the inspector at all when inspecting the element. Go back to your code and check that you are using the correct selector. Issue #2: Specificity Issue If you can see the styles in the inspector for that element, but the styles are crossed out then it means that that are being overidden by another style. You can then adjust your selector to be more specific (or make the conflicting style less specific) to prevent the conflict. This is a very common issue and it’s the reason why when you are writing your CSS you should be careful to make sure that you are only as specific as you need to be (and why we generally avoid using ids for selectors). Issue #3: Invalid property The final issue is an invalid property, most commonly because it’s mis-spelled.  Here we can see that the colour: red property isn’t being applied because ‘color’ is mis-spelled. We can also see that display: inline-block is crossed out, which means the display property is set elsewhere with a higher specificity. "

						"category": "",
						"url": " /e-Layouts/1.%20The%20Display%20Property/",
						"content": "Display is CSS’s most important property for controlling layout. All elements in CSS have a display of either Block or Inline by default, what’s the difference and why does that matter? Block level elements take up the entire available width of the container they are in and stack on top of each other on a new line. Some examples of block level elements are &lt;div&gt; and &lt;p&gt;. Inline level elements take up only the width that they need for their content and fall into the normal flow of the document, lining up next to each other rather than always starting on a new line. For this reason, inline elements are usually small elements, line a &lt;span&gt; of text or an &lt;a&gt; link. Inline elements are boxes (like all elements) that behave like text. They flow left to right and top to bottom, falling down onto the next line whenever there isn’t space on the current line just like text. We set the display property to block, inline or inline-block (which we will touch on soon) through the display property. img { display: block; } Inline-Block then is a mix of the properties of inline and block. They flow on the page as though they were inline elements, but preserve some of their block capabilities such as setting width and height, top and bottom margins and padding etc. There are a couple of reasons we use inline-block. It’s helpful when you have an inline element that you want to have height or width properties, or you want to place multiple block-like elements on the same horizontal line. Display: None When set to display: none; an element will dissapear from the screen as though it isn’t in the html at all. Why would we want that? Although in most cases it wouldn’t be very helpful is something was permanently hidden, it’s very useful to show and hide things – we’ll use this in both javascript and responsive design. KEY TAKEAWAYS: when trying to style links that aren’t in a paragraph (like menu items or buttons) set to display: inline-block so that they will behave as expected and accept vertical margin images you can typically set to display: block; if you want to center using margin-auto or display: inline-block if you want to center using text-align center. while editing your site, try to set * { border: 1px solid #cccccc} so that you can see where every element is sitting and how much space it takes up. This will help you troubleshoot any issues. You can see in the example below that spans, images, and links are all inline elements by default that only take up as much space as the content whereas most other elements take up a whole row. See the Pen Display Property - Block vs Inline-Block by The Institute of Code (@instituteofcode) on CodePen."

						"content": "Gridlex is a library to make creating building flexbox grids easier. Normally to create grids (ie three column grid, 4 column grid), we would need to calculate the width + margin of every column width separately, write the css for it, etc. Gridlex is a css stylesheet that someone has already written to make this process simpler, we just need to connect it to our site and reference the class names that it uses.  To use any external library or resources, we start by adding it in the head.  &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https: cdnjs.cloudflare.com ajax libs gridlex 2.6.0 gridlex.min.css\"&gt; Then simplest way to create grids with gridlex is to add a class of grid to the container element and a class of col to all of the children &lt;div class=\"grid\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt; div&gt; Introducing the 12 col grid Web design often operates on either a 12 or a 16 column grid, where the page is divided up into twelfths and layouts are created based on how many 12th they take up. So half the page would be 12 2  = 6 columns. A third of the page would be 12 4 = 3 columns. A full page width always ads to 12.  Example: 2 column grid &lt;div class=\"grid\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt; div&gt; Example: 3 column grid &lt;div class=\"grid\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-4\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-4\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-4\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt; div&gt; Example: a 4 column grid &lt;div class=\"grid\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt; div&gt; At first it seems confusing that to create three columns you use ‘col-4’ and to create 4 columns you use ‘col-3’ but after a while it becomes second nature.  Example: Mixed Columns  What about a container that looked like this?  &lt;div class=\"grid\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-4\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-8\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt; div&gt;  "

						"content": "When designing responsively we need more than just fluid layouts (ie by using % widths rather than pixel widths). We often want to actually change the styles and layouts based on the size of the viewer’s screen or browser, and we can do that with media queries and responsive gridlex classes. Responsive Grids  One of the best things about Gridlex is how easy it is to create responsive grids.  You just add ‘_size-colwidth’ to the end of the column size. So if you want it to be 6 columns wide on desktop, but collapse to full width on mobile you would write  &lt;div class=\"grid\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6_sm-12\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-6_sm-12\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt; div&gt; Gridlex has 4 sizes built in (large, medium, small and extra-small) each with set pixel widths that they are activated. You can change at multiple levels to. For example, let’s say you have a 4 column grid, that you want to drop to a 2 column grid on tablets and full width on mobile. This is what that would look like.. all without touching a line of css.  &lt;div class=\"grid\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3_md-6_sm-12\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3_md-6_sm-12\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3_md-6_sm-12\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt;div class=\"col-3_md-6_sm-12\"&gt; ... &lt; div&gt; &lt; div&gt; Understanding Media Queries Media queries introduce nesting to our CSS, just like we are already using for our HTML and any CSS written within the curly brackets of the media query is only applied if the browser width matches the criteria in the media query. @media (max-width:720px) { ... } Any CSS selectors and properties written within this media query (where the … is) would only be applied if the screen width was 720px or smaller. As with html, when we are nesting CSS we indent in the CSS that’s inside the media query. Any CSS can be written inside the media query, but common practices include changing the width of columns and adjusting the grid layout, simplifying the design, creating responsive menus, and showing and hiding elements. SHOWING AND HIDING ELEMENTS There is another display property value that we haven’t introduced yet which is display: none;. There is a pretty obvious reason for this, because if you were to apply display to all screen sizes then you may as well not create the element at all! Setting the display to none on certain screen sizes and then setting it back to block inline or inline-block on other screen sizes allows you to customise what is displayed on your site for other devices and screen sizes. Example - when the screen is smaller than 720px, anything with a class of mob-hide would dissapear, the header padding would shrink to 1% and the footer nav links would change their font-size and padding. @media (max-width:720px) { .mob-hide { display: none; } header { padding: 1%; } footer nav a { font-size:1rem; padding: 0.5rem; } }"

Using CSS Resets If you look at your HTML document before you have added any CSS there are still some styles applied. Headings look different to paragraphs, links are blue and so on. It also can look different in different browsers as each browser has its own ‘default styles’. So how Google Chrome renders headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth may be different from how Internet Explorer does. To ensure cross-browser compatibility, CSS resets have become widely used. CSS resets take every common HTML element with a predefined style and provide one unified style for all browsers. These resets generally involve removing any sizing, margins, paddings, or additional styles and toning these values down. Because CSS cascades from top to bottom our reset needs to be at the very top of our style sheet so that we don’t override any custom styles. Doing so ensures that those styles are read first and that all of the different web browsers are working from a common baseline. A simple option, which we will use throughout the course is just a basic reset by adding this code to the top of our CSS file. The * selector selects all of the html elements. * { box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0; padding: 0; } There are then some other common ‘resets’ that we often use to ensure that everything flows as expected, like img { max-width: 100%; } a { color: inherit; }"

						"content": "In this lesson, we’re going to be uploading our website to Netlify’s free hosting and connecting a custom domain name. We’ll be demonstrating with a domain purchased on GoDaddy but all domain providers function pretty much the same way. There are two different options. We can continue to use our domain provider for DNS management, and add the domain with an A Record, or we can use Netlify’s DNS. Remember that if you change to Netlify’s DNS and you already have other services (like custom email) connected to your domain then that connection will break so for that I recommend using the A Record method. Another option we will demonstrate is hosting your website with CloudCannon which makes it easy for any non-technical user to host their website. This option isn’t free however, it’s $25 per month but you can host unlimited website for that price."

You should bookmark it and come back to it later.  One of the biggest parts of being a developer is being resourceful and being able to problem solve. In a learning environment it is very easy to put your hand up and just ask a mentor for help, but what happens when the real world comes? Being able to look for solutions on line will not only allow you to learn more, but also will allow you to see into the community that developers have. Inspect Element Introducing the inspector. Google Chrome Inspector is going to be your best friend as a developer, it’s a way to troubleshoot issues, test out styles quickly in the browser and check what styles are being applied to each element. Before you move forward, you should know how to: identify the HTML &amp; CSS sections of the inspector how to ‘select’ an element with the inspector to investigate it’s styles how to test your site responsively how to test your site on slow connections how to view the sources of a loaded website to see if external assets and files are being loaded correctly how to edit styles in the browser and then copy these styles to your website Troubleshooting CSS Checklist If you can’t see your changes at all in the inspection, first check that all your files saved and have you refreshed the page. If your styles aren’t appearing in the styles tab of the inspector for that particular element, then you probably have a problem with the selector. Check that your selector is accurate and that you aren’t missing any curly brackets or semi-colons. If styles are there but have a little yellow warning symbol, then there is something wrong with that property. Check the spelling (ie color not colour) and look up your CSS property reference here or in one of the resources below to check the proper format for that property ie you have written border: 1px black;but are missing the a required value and need to say border: 1px solid black;. If the styles are there but crossed out then you have a specificity problem – check which other style is overridding it and then either remove the other style make it less specific, or make the selector you are trying to use more specific. For example, if you had an a { ... } selector that was being overrided by nav a { ... } then you might want to target header nav a { ... }.

						"content": "During the course you will build 2-3 responsive websites in HTML, CSS, jQuery &amp; Jekyll. The first website is a demo website for a mattress company, that we will all build together and you can use as a base for future projects.  The second website is your choice. Some students build a personal portfolio site, a blog, a site for their business or their friends business. It doesn’t have to be a ‘real’ site – some students prefer to create a project for a hypothetical business (like a cafe or consulting firm) – but regardless of what you plan to build the more planning you can do before the course starts the easier it will be. We want your time on retreat to focus more on learning to code and less on picking font combinations and colors after all!  Some questions to ask yourself before you arrive…  what website do I want to build?  A new travel blog to document my adventures.  what is the goal of the website? For example, a cafe website might have the goal to showcase their beautiful food, highlight their vegan-friendly menu, help people find them and know their opening hours, etc.  What content do you need to display? Example - gallery, hours, testimonials, about bios for each staff member, contact form, etc.  What is the personality of the brand, or the vibe you are going for aesthetically? Modern and professional? Playfun and fun?  Do I already have any of the assets (logo, images, copy) or styles (fonts, colors, etc) or am I needing to come up with those?  Who else’s approval do I need?  For example if you are building a site for a friend’s business you would likely need to be on the same page with them about what the site will look and feel like, and how the content will flow.  Stages of Web Design Each project varies as to who completes each stage of this process. Sometimes as a web developer, you are working with a client that already has a solid understanding of their strategy &amp; design and your job is just to build the site. But it’s interesting to see the whole process, even if you will only be jumping in at the later stages.  1. Strategy For a real client project, the first thing I would recommend is to really dig into the strategic view of the website. This includes questions from like… Why do you want a website? What do you hope it will achieve? Are these goals something we can realistically accomplish? For example a small business owner might tell you they “just want a website” but really their business is struggling and they want more customers. Just having a beautiful website won’t automatically bring them more customers, they need to make sure that (A) their target customer is actually discovering the website and (B) that when they come to the website they take the desired action – like book an appointment or come in-store.  Who is your target customer? What are their problems, goals, concerns? For example for a restaurant maybe they want to know that the ambience is nice, the food is good and that it caters to their dietary requirements. What else do we know about this target audience? Is it young hip mums on their way back from school or the local seniors club? As you can probably imagine, the ‘ideal design’ for a site that will be viewed by mostly tech-savvy teenagers is very different to the ideal design that’s targeting seniors.  Where and why will your customers be viewing your website? Are they on their phones looking for directions to your website? Sitting around the dinner table? This helps you think about and plan for exactly what content is most important for them to see.  2. Design  When considering the design of your website, it’s always best to have first gotten a solid understanding of the overall strategy so that you aren’t just following what’s pretty but designing it based of what will be most effective.  We’re going to use what’s called a ‘modular design’ approach where we design modular ‘building blocks’ that we can then build a website out of. This makes sites faster to build, easier to maintain and more scalable. When you want to add extra pages, rather than having to design new pages from scratch you can ‘assemble’ them using building blocks you have already created.  Below is an example of some of these ‘blocks’. If you use a block multiple times throughout a website (as is common) you can change the content (images, text) and tweak the styles between use use. Maybe the signup banner has a black background on one page and an orange background on another page.  What this does however is dramatically speed up the web development process (and typically time is money) as well as gives you the flexibility to quickly adapt pages as you go.  We use this process at IOC, and it means that we can build new, custom pages on our website that have a unique look and feel (but at the same time consistent with the overall site) very quickly.  I would wager that most simple sites could be built with just a header + footer + 8-10 extra blocks.  If you have a blog, then you’ll also need some blocks or layouts specifically for the blog. Here is an example of that, on the left is the page that shows all the recent blog posts, and on the write the full post. Both use the same layout that has a ‘sidebar’ block.  In addition to building each block, you might also create a ‘style guide’ that showcases basic typography styles, button styles etc. This helps ensure that any text blocks look consistent across the site.   3. Build  The design stage varies from person to person – some people create a simple wireframe, find some inspiration and then just code the site from there. Other’s have a ‘pixel-perfect’ photoshop or illustrator design outlaying exactly how the site should look on desktop, mobile, etc.  Which method you choose comes down to personal preference as a developer and the other stakeholders in mind – sometimes if you are working with a client it’s easier to get them to sign-off during the design phase so that they don’t try to change things once the site is already coded.  We’ll show you the build process during the course, but it basically flows from creating the overall structure and layout of the site, and goes from there.  Activities:  Complete the strategy activities above unless that stage has already been completed for you.  Find 1-5 websites in the style you like  Try to plan out (on pen and paper or in an app like adobe Experience Design) 5 - 10 ‘blocks’ that you think you could use Play with this style guide (fork it first so you can save it) testing out the fonts and colors you think you want to use.  Example Style Guide See the Pen Medium Style Guide by The Institute of Code (@instituteofcode) on CodePen.  "
