### Cascading Style Sheets

So far we have looked at how to select elements and apply styles to them, but what if there are **conflicting styles**?

For example if we set the `body` (which includes all elements) to have a color of red, and then set the `<h1>` to have a color of blue, what color will the `<h1>` be? Luckily when there is a conflict between instructions, CSS has rules to determine which styles to use and which to ignore. It determines in the following order:

### 1. It cascades from top to bottom

Styles declared at the bottom of the stylesheet override styles at the top of the stylesheet.

```css
  p { background: orange; font-size: 24px; }
  h1{ color: red; }
  p { background: green; }
```

In this example, the paragraph elements would have a **background color of green**, because it comes below the background of orange and thus takes precedence in the cascade. The font size would remain 24px because there is no new font-size overriding it.

This is also why we also list our own stylesheet last in the head of the html (below external stylesheets) -- so that if there are conflicting styles, ours take precedent.&nbsp;

### 2. It cascades based on specificity.

Every selector in CSS has a specificity weight. This, along with the placement in the cascade, identifies how styles will be rendered. The element type selector has the lowest specificity, then the class selector, then the ID selector. So a selector that selects a class will override one that selects an element type, and a selector that selects ID will override a conflicting one that selects based on class even if it comes later in the document.

> Classes are more specific than element names, and ids are more specific that classes.

For some people it's easier to understand specificity by [looking at this calculator](https://specificity.keegan.st/) which will tell you the numerical specificity 'value' of each selector.

In mathematical terms, an ID has a specificity of 100, a class / attribute / psuedo-class has a specificity of 10 and an element or pseudo-element has a specificity of 1.&nbsp;

So a selector that used two classes and an element selector (ie **section .button.featured**) would have a specificity weight of 21.

## Troubleshooting CSS Issues

One of the most common css issues you will face is where you have two conflicting styles in your css and the one that you want to apply is being overridden by another.

The best way to figure this out is to use the inspector. When you inspect element, in the styles panel you will see which styles are being applied to your element. Here are the three common issues and their solutions.

### Issue #1: Incorrect Selector

If you haven't used a correct selector (ie spelling mistake, missing a space or a full stop, etc) then you **won't see the style appear in the inspector at all** when inspecting the element. Go back to your code and check that you are using the correct selector.

### Issue #2: Specificity Issue

If you can see the styles in the inspector for that element, but the **styles are crossed out** then it means that that are being overidden by another style. You can then adjust your selector to be more specific (or make the conflicting style less specific) to prevent the conflict.

This is a very common issue and it's the reason why when you are writing your CSS you should be careful to make sure that you are only as specific as you need to be (and why we generally avoid using ids for selectors).

### Issue #3: Invalid property

The final issue is an invalid property, most commonly because it's mis-spelled.&nbsp;

Here we can see that the `colour: red` property isn't being applied because 'color' is mis-spelled. We can also see that `display: inline-block` is crossed out, which means the display property is set elsewhere with a higher specificity.&nbsp;
