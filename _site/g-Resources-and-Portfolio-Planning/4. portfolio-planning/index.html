				<!-- needs is needed??? -->

<p>During the course you will build 2-3 responsive websites in HTML, CSS, jQuery &amp; Jekyll. The first website is a demo website for a mattress company, that we will all build together and you can use as a base for future projects. </p>

<p>The second website is your choice. Some students build a personal portfolio site, a blog, a site for their business or their friends business. It doesn’t have to be a ‘real’ site – some students prefer to create a project for a hypothetical business (like a cafe or consulting firm) – but regardless of what you plan to build the more planning you can do before the course starts the easier it will be.</p>

<p>We want your time on retreat to focus more on learning to code and less on picking font combinations and colors after all! </p>

<p>Some questions to ask yourself before you arrive… </p>

<ul>
  <li>what website do I want to build? 
    <ul>
      <li>A new travel blog to document my adventures. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>what is the goal of the website?
    <ul>
      <li>For example, a cafe website might have the goal to showcase their beautiful food, highlight their vegan-friendly menu, help people find them and know their opening hours, etc. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What content do you need to display?
    <ul>
      <li>Example - gallery, hours, testimonials, about bios for each staff member, contact form, etc. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What is the personality of the brand, or the vibe you are going for aesthetically?
    <ul>
      <li>Modern and professional? Playfun and fun? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do I already have any of the assets (logo, images, copy) or styles (fonts, colors, etc) or am I needing to come up with those? </li>
  <li>Who else’s approval do I need? 
    <ul>
      <li>For example if you are building a site for a friend’s business you would likely need to be on the same page with them about what the site will look and feel like, and how the content will flow. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stages-of-web-design">Stages of Web Design</h2>

<p>Each project varies as to who completes each stage of this process. Sometimes as a web developer, you are working with a client that already has a solid understanding of their strategy &amp; design and your job is just to build the site. But it’s interesting to see the whole process, even if you will only be jumping in at the later stages. </p>

<h3 id="1-strategy"><strong>1. Strategy</strong></h3>

<p>For a real client project, the first thing I would recommend is to really dig into the strategic view of the website. This includes questions from like…</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Why do you want a website?</strong> What do you hope it will achieve? Are these goals something we can realistically accomplish? For example a small business owner might tell you they “just want a website” but really their business is struggling and they want more customers. Just having a beautiful website won’t automatically bring them more customers, they need to make sure that (A) their target customer is actually discovering the website and (B) that when they come to the website they take the desired action – like book an appointment or come in-store. </li>
  <li><strong>Who is your target customer?</strong> What are their problems, goals, concerns? For example for a restaurant maybe they want to know that the ambience is nice, the food is good and that it caters to their dietary requirements. What else do we know about this target audience? Is it young hip mums on their way back from school or the local seniors club? As you can probably imagine, the ‘ideal design’ for a site that will be viewed by mostly tech-savvy teenagers is very different to the ideal design that’s targeting seniors. </li>
  <li><strong>Where and why will your customers be viewing your website?</strong> Are they on their phones looking for directions to your website? Sitting around the dinner table? This helps you think about and plan for exactly what content is most important for them to see. </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="2-design">2. Design </h3>

<p>When considering the design of your website, it’s always best to have first gotten a solid understanding of the overall strategy so that you aren’t just following what’s pretty but designing it based of what will be most effective. </p>

<p>We’re going to use what’s called a ‘modular design’ approach where we design modular ‘building blocks’ that we can then build a website out of. This makes sites faster to build, easier to maintain and more scalable. When you want to add extra pages, rather than having to design new pages from scratch you can ‘assemble’ them using building blocks you have already created. </p>

<p><img src="/uploads/modular-example.jpg" alt="Image from Mindstream Interactive" title="Image from Mindstream Interactive" /></p>

<p>Below is an example of some of these ‘blocks’. If you use a block multiple times throughout a website (as is common) you can change the content (images, text) and tweak the styles between use use. Maybe the signup banner has a black background on one page and an orange background on another page. </p>

<p><img src="/uploads/modular-website-blocks.png" alt="" srcset="/uploads/modular-website-blocks@2x.png 1600w" /></p>

<p>What this does however is dramatically speed up the web development process (and typically time is money) as well as gives you the flexibility to quickly adapt pages as you go. </p>

<p>We use this process at IOC, and it means that we can build new, custom pages on our website that have a unique look and feel (but at the same time consistent with the overall site) very quickly. </p>

<p>I would wager that most simple sites could be built with just a header + footer + 8-10 extra blocks. </p>

<p>If you have a blog, then you’ll also need some blocks or layouts specifically for the blog. Here is an example of that, on the left is the page that shows all the recent blog posts, and on the write the full post. Both use the same layout that has a ‘sidebar’ block. <br /><br /><img src="/uploads/screen-shot-2019-01-17-at-9-09-52-am.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In addition to building each block, you might also create a ‘style guide’ that showcases basic typography styles, button styles etc. This helps ensure that any text blocks look consistent across the site.  </p>

<h3 id="3-build">3. Build </h3>

<p>The design stage varies from person to person – some people create a simple wireframe, find some inspiration and then just code the site from there. Other’s have a ‘pixel-perfect’ photoshop or illustrator design outlaying exactly how the site should look on desktop, mobile, etc. </p>

<p>Which method you choose comes down to personal preference as a developer and the other stakeholders in mind – sometimes if you are working with a client it’s easier to get them to sign-off during the design phase so that they don’t try to change things once the site is already coded. </p>

<p>We’ll show you the build process during the course, but it basically flows from creating the overall structure and layout of the site, and goes from there. </p>

<h3 id="activities"><strong>Activities: </strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>Complete the strategy activities above unless that stage has already been completed for you. </li>
  <li>Find 1-5 websites in the style you like </li>
  <li>Try to plan out (on pen and paper or in an app like adobe Experience Design) 5 - 10 ‘blocks’ that you think you could use</li>
  <li><a href="https://codepen.io/instituteofcode/pen/eWzgWJ">Play with this style guide</a> (fork it first so you can save it) testing out the fonts and colors you think you want to use. </li>
</ol>
