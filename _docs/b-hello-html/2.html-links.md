### Basic Links

The simplest form of a link is: `html <a href="/about.html"> About </a>`

In the example above we have created a text link, but you can actually wrap any html element in a link. For example, this will create a link around an image, so that when you click on the image you will navigate to the about page.

~~~html
<a href="/about.html">
    <img src="/images/photo.jpg">
</a>
~~~

You can even wrap whole sections in a link. This is quite common for say a blog post excerpt where you want someone to be able to click on any part in order to go to the blog post. In this way it's functioning kind of like a container element (which we'll learn about soon) as well as a link.

~~~html
<a href="/about.html">
    <img src="/images/photo.jpg">
    <h3> My Blog Post </h3>
    <p> This is a short description of my blog post </p>
</a>
~~~

### Linking to an Email Address

When we add an email address to the page, we often want to make it easier on the user by allowing them to click to send an email. To create an email link that will open a new message in the person’s default mail client we just need to create an `<a>` link where the href attribute value starts with `mailto:`

~~~html
<a href="mailto:tina@instituteofcode.com">Email me</a>
~~~

To populate the subject field, we just add `?subject=` after the email address. The question mark binds the first new parameter to the hyperlink path. To add an additional parameter, we just use an ampersand `&` to add an additional parameter.

For example, lets create a link that sends an email to tina@instituteofcode.com with a subject line of *'Hello friend'* and a body of *'How are you?\*\*'*. We can’t have spaces in links, so we need to encode the space by using the phrase *'%20'*

~~~html
<a href="mailto:tina@instituteofcode.com?subject=Hello%20friend&body=How%20are%20you?">Email me</a>
~~~

That can be time consuming so if you have a long subject or message you can always use a [mailto link generator](http://www.mailto.co.uk/).

### Making a link open in a new tab

There is an attribute called ‘target’. If you set it to `target="_blank"` your links will then to open the link in a new tab. This link below would open google in a new tab.

~~~html
<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank"> Email me </a>
~~~

### Linking to other sections on the page

Normal links always go to the top of the page, but what if we wanted to link to a specific section of the page? Using anchor links we can take someone to a specific point on a specific page. To create this we need a link which points to an anchor, and the anchor itself (an element with an id).

To do this we would create an `id` attribute on the element that we wanted to link to (ie a section, div or heading perhaps). After doing this, you can create a link that points to this anchor by using the \# symbol in from of the anchor name. To navigate to an anchor on the same page you would just write something like this and it would take you to the section of the page with an id of services (`<section id="services">`)

~~~html
<a href="#services">Services</a>
~~~

And if you wanted to link to an anchor on another page you would use the full URL like this:

~~~html
<a href="/about#services">Go to the services section on the about page</a>
~~~

### How do you create a button?&nbsp;
{: .codepen}

This is kind of a trick question, because buttons are just normal anchor links that have been styled by css to look like a link. While there is actually a &lt;button&gt; element that you might stumble upon, that actually has a different purpose all together so stick to anchor links for now.&nbsp;

Common practice is to create a class of 'button' to style all of the links that you want to look like buttons.&nbsp;

`<a href="/about" class="button">CLICK ME</a>`{: .language-html}

### Linking to files (like downloadable PDFs)

It's actually really easy to let people download a PDF, Mp3 etc from your site just using a normal link. All you have to do is first add the file to your website folder, and then link to it just like it were an image or a page.&nbsp;

`<a href="/media-kit.pdf" class="button">DOWNLOAD MEDIA KIT</a>`{: .language-html}
