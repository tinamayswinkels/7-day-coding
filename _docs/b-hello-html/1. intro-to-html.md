While getting started with HTML, you will likely encounter new—and often strange—terms. Over time you will become more and more familiar with all of them, but the three common HTML terms you should begin with are elements, tags, and attributes.

## Elements & Tags

Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. Some of the more frequently used elements include multiple levels of headings (identified as `<h1>` through `<h6>` elements) and paragraphs (identified as the `<p>` element); the list goes on to include the `<a>, <img>, <div> and <nav>` elements, and many more.

The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a **tag**. Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags.

An **opening tag** marks the beginning of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by an element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, `<div>`.

A **closing tag** marks the end of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by a forward slash and the element’s name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example, `</div>`.

The content that falls between the opening and closing tags is the content of that element. A paragraph, for example, will have an opening tag of `<p>` and a closing tag of `</p>`. What falls between these two tags will be the content of the paragraph.

So, a paragraph element is created with an opening tag, some content and a closing tag.

~~~html
<p> ... </p>
~~~

## Common HTML Elements

~~~html
<h1> This is a level 1 heading </h1>
<h2> This is a level 2 heading </h2>
<h3> This is a level 3 heading <h3>
<p> This is a paragraph <p>
<img src="/logo.png">
<a href="http://www.url.com"> This is a link <a>
~~~

---

## Attributes

**Attributes** are properties used to provide additional information about an element to the browser.

~~~html
<element attribute-name="attribute-value"> ... </element>
~~~

When we create a link, if we just wrote &lt;a&gt; click me &lt;/a&gt; the browser would know that we had created a link, but wouldn't know where to send it. For example, this is an`<a>` element with a **href**&nbsp;(short for hyperlink reference) attribute. This code will take users to http:// www.google.com when they click the *“Click here to go to google”* text.

~~~html
<a href="http://www.google.com/"> Click here to go to google. </a>
~~~

Images also need an attribute to tell them where to find the source image. In the example below, the&nbsp;**image element** displays an image that you have uploaded into your website folder called ‘logo.png’ with the **alternate text** (for slow loading devices, visually impaired and SEO) of ‘Website Logo’ to describe the image.

~~~html
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Website Logo">
~~~

There are two kinds of images you can add with HTML, images that are hosted on your own website (like the one above) and images that are hosted elsewhere where you would use a full url (for example *http://www.website.com/images/photo.png*) as the source.&nbsp;

Some attributes are required for that element to function (like the src attribute for images or the href attribute for links) while others are optional, like the class or id attribute (we’ll learn more about what they do later). We can add a class to just about any element, such as a h2 heading.

~~~html
<h2 class=“featured”> This is a heading </h2>
~~~

There is no limit on how many attributes one element can have.&nbsp;

~~~html
<a href="/form.html" class=“button” id="apply"> Apply Now </a>
~~~

## Self-Closing Elements

In the previous example, the `<img>` element had only an opening tag and didn’t include a closing tag. Fear not, this was intentional. Not all elements consist of opening and closing tags. Some elements simply receive their content or behaviour from attributes within a single tag. The `<img>` element is one of these elements. The content of the previous `<img>` element is assigned with the use of the source attribute and value. Common self-closing elements include: `<img> <link> <embed> <meta>`

---

## Nesting Elements

We organise and structure our HTML document in two ways – through the order, from top to bottom, and by nesting elements inside other elements. The easiest way to think about it is that each HTML element is like a basket that can hold content, other baskets or both.

In this example we start with a`<html>` element, and within this there is a `<head>` element and a `<body>` element. Nested inside the head element we have a `<title>` element and nested within the`<body>` element is a `<header>` element, a couple of `<section>` elements and a `<footer>` element, and so on.

Then inside the `header` element we have a `h1` and a `nav`.

~~~html
<html>
<!-- This is the head -->
<head>
    <title> This is my Website Title </title>
</head>
<!-- This is the body -->
<body>
    <header>
        <h1> Hello World </h1>
        <nav> ... </nav>
    </header>
    <section> ... </section>
    <section> ...</section>
    <footer> ... </footer>
</body>
</html>
~~~

Any element that is nested inside another is considered a ‘child’ of that element. So the `h1` is a child of the `header`, and then `body` is the parent of the `footer`. This structure becomes important later on when we are styling the document.

All elements that are inside the body element, that is between it's open tag and close tag are considered descendents (the children, grandchildren, etc.)

It's important that you tab in each level of descendent to make it easy to understand the hierarchy.

### Review Questions

Before you arrive you should be able to answer these questions off the top of your head. Try looking away from your notes and testing yourself.

1. How do you create a paragraph? How about a H1 heading, or a h3 heading?
2. Write the code to create an image (hint, it's hosted at http://website.com/logo.jpg)
3. Write the code to create an anchor link that says 'Click Me' and goes to www.instituteofcode.com
4. What is an attribute? Where do you put at attribute within a html element?
5. Which elements 'self-close'?
