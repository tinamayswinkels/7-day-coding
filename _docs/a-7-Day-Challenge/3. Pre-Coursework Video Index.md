Welcome to day 1 of the 7 day beginners coding challenge\! Today we're going to look at how to create HTML elements in codepen, a code playground that allows us to start coding right away without needing to set up our HTML document or do anything else.

{% include youtube.html id="gWZ-kWDbC-w" %}

**HTML Syntax:&nbsp;**

~~~
<element> Content to display </element>
<element attribute="value"> Content to display </element>
~~~

The main text elements are 6 levels of headings (from h1 through to h6), paragraphs and anchor links.&nbsp;

* **H1:**`<h1> Heading 1 </h1>`
* **H2:**`<h2> Subheading </h2>`
* **H3:**`<h3> Even less important heading </h3>`
* **Paragraphs:**`<p> This is a short paragraph. One paragraph can have multiple sentences. </p>`
* **Links:**`<a href="http://www.google.com"> Google it </a>`

## Activity&nbsp;

1. Create a h1 heading with your name&nbsp;
2. Create a h2 heading with your job title&nbsp;
3. Create a paragraph that describes you&nbsp;
4. Inside that paragraph add a link to one of your social media pages
5. Save your Codepen\!
