It's our last day of this challenge\! Crazy to look back and reflect on how much you have learnt so far in just ~ 30 minutes per day for 7 days. When people first hear about IOC and our immersive bootcamp program, the most common question we have is 'How much can you really learn in 10 days?'. It seems crazy at first that you could really learn such a valuable new skill in only a few weeks.&nbsp;<br><br>But when you add up ~ 4 hours per week of pre-coursework + 8 hours per day on the bootcamp that's over 100 hours of immersive lessons, and most of them sitting side-by-side with an instructor with years of experience.<br><br>So when you look at how much you have learnt in only ~ 4 hours of tutorials this week, it's not hard to imagine building a serious web development skills with 100 hours\!&nbsp;<br><br>For this last lesson, make sure that you have completed the last tutorial from yesterday, splash page 4 so you understand how to build a project locally.&nbsp;
