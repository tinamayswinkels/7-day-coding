Our Website in a Weekend Online Course&nbsp;

We've had so many questions about [our online course](https://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev-101/){: target="_blank"}, that we wanted to jump in and answer them here\!&nbsp;

**1\. What does this cover that we haven't already learnt?&nbsp;**

It digs deeper into HTML & CSS, including more advanced styling, and making your website responsive (adapt to mobile and tablet devices). By the end of the course you'll have the skills and resources to build a complete website from scratch.&nbsp;<br><br>Beyond that it also covers performance optimisation and the basics of SEO (search engine optimisation).&nbsp;

**2\. What kind of website will you be able to build?&nbsp;**<br><br>Website in a Weekend includes in-depth tutorials that help you go beyond the basics that you learnt in the 7 day challenge and learn how to build a custom website that built just for you.&nbsp;<br><br>To give you the flexibility of custom code, with the convenience of a drag-and-drop template we've coded this with modular website framework for you – building blocks of HTML & CSS that you can copy + paste + customise to build a brand new website in no time.&nbsp;

## Our Hybrid Bootcamp in Bali

Looking to take things to the next level? Our [hybrid bootcamp](http://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev){: target="_blank"} (6 weeks part time online + 10 day intensive in Bali + lifetime support) might be exactly what you need.&nbsp;

This program goes well beyond the basics and teaches you how to build a freelance career as a web developer (or land a job at an agency if that's more your thing).&nbsp;

**A few highlights in the curriculum:&nbsp;**<br>\- learning how to use jQuery (a library for Javascript) to add interactive elements like pop-up lightbox galleries, sliders / carousels, hamburger mobile menus etc.&nbsp;<br>\- how to create dynamic layouts for things like blog posts or project pages using jekyll<br>\- how to create smooth animations on hover and other transitions&nbsp;<br>\- how to add custom contact forms that sync with a CRM like Hubspot<br>\- how to create advanced designs with overlapping elements (like the IOC website)<br>\- advanced performance optimisation in every browser and on mobile devices&nbsp;

Check out our [course page](http://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev){: target="_blank"} for all the details and examples of student projects\!&nbsp;<br><br>The main difference though between an online course and in-person immersive is in the practical experience – it's one thing to understand the theory of specific properties; It's another thing completely to build an entire website from scratch. We focus in the bootcamp on taking the skills you have learnt in the video modules and applying them, building things and breaking things, learning how to troubleshoot and write efficient code. So that by the time you finish the program you can confidently build advanced websites for yourself or clients, from start to finish.&nbsp;

Oh, and it doesn't hurt that our program is all-inclusive in this beautiful villa in Bali complete with chef prepared meals and daily yoga to help you get into the flow state ideal for learning.&nbsp;
