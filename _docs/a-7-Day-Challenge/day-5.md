It's finally time to build a real splash page\! We've created 3 simple designs and recorded a video tutorial and Codepen example for each one, so you can get your creative juices flowing. Tomorrow we'll show you had to add interactive elements like a google map and how to actually make it live if you want to\!&nbsp;<br><br>Apologies if I moved a bit fast in this one, I introduced a few extra topics that weren't supposed to be included in the free challenge but I just knew that you would want to learn them\!&nbsp;
