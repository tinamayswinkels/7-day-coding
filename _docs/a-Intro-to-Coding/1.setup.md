There are a few things that we use during the course that we ask you to download/set up for both the practice challenges and the course in general.

## Browser: Chrome

We'll be using Chrome to preview and test our websites, as it has the best developer tools. Download the latest version of Google [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html?brand=CHBD&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwyN7JBRCZn7LKgb3ki8kBEiQAaLEsqsFu3ctUicvTCQW604YrV3Hi7ARsHYaHcSsjf9qChdQaAvB48P8HAQ&amp;dclid=CPLY5dOerdQCFQiIaAodWWUCBQ)

## Online Code Editor: CodePen

Next you will need a CodePen account. CodePen is a great site for testing code when you don't want to set up a folder and files for tiny snippets of code. Go to [http://codepen.io/](http://codepen.io/) and click on the Sign Up button on the top right corner. Scroll to the Free Plan and Sign Up.

We'll be using codepen regularly to learn new coding concepts or play with ideas straight from the browser.

## Code Editor: Atom

Go to [https://atom.io/]() download the latest version.

Atom is the code editor that we are using to write code and build your website projects. You can write code in any text editor (even simple applications like text-edit) but code editors like Atom have additional functionality that makes web development easier, like code hints and color coding the syntax.
<!--Watch this video for tips on how to setup and customise Atom to suit you.&nbsp;--><!--&lt;&lt;&lt;ADD VIDEO&gt;&gt;&gt;-->

## Design Tool: Adobe Experience Design

[Download](https://www.adobe.com/sea/products/experience-design.html) Adobe Experience Design (it's free\!). This is a great tool to create wireframes or mockups of your portfolio website. We will be sending you the template for the first website you will be creating in Adobe Experience Design if you want to experiment with the colors and fonts.

## Github

Github is a version control tool – it allows us to save every version of our websites, review past changes, etc.

Head to Github.com and create a free account and download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

## Jekyll

**FOR MAC USERS** – [Download xCode](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) We'll be using Xcode to install Jekyll (which is how we'll be building blogs and more complex websites)

**FOR WINDOWS USERS** – It's a little more complicated, so don't worry about installing anything at this step.. we'll help you when you arrive.

## General&nbsp; -->

**FOR MAC USERS** – Make sure your Mac OS is running one of the last 3 versions (OS X Sierra, Mojave or Catalina) and if it isn't [update it here](http://www.apple.com/au/macos/how-to-upgrade/).
