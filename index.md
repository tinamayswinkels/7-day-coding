## Our Website in a Weekend Online Course&nbsp;

We've had so many questions about [our online course](https://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev-101/){: target="_blank"}, that we wanted to jump in and answer them here\!&nbsp;

**1\. What does this cover that we haven't already learnt?&nbsp;**

It digs deeper into HTML & CSS, including more advanced styling, and making your website responsive (adapt to mobile and tablet devices). By the end of the course you'll have the skills and resources to build a complete website from scratch.&nbsp;

**2\. What kind of website will you be able to build?&nbsp;**<br><br>At the moment there is one single-page web site template included (more advanced than what you have built currently) and in-depth tutorials allowing you to go beyond this.&nbsp;<br><br>Over the next two months we're adding dozens of new tutorials, additional templates AND these modular website templates – building blocks of HTML & CSS that you can copy + paste + customise to build a brand new website in no time.&nbsp;

If you enroll in the course now, you'll receive access to all future updates and tutorials at no additional cost.&nbsp;

**3\. How much does Website in a Weekend cost?&nbsp;**<br><br>As soon as we release the additional tutorials mentioned above the price will be increasing to $450. It's currently $250, and we're giving all 7 day coding challenge participants a coupon '[7DAYCODING](https://ioc.podia.com/web-dev-101?coupon=7DAYCODING){: target="_blank"}' to receive $100 off for the next two weeks only.&nbsp;<br><br>If you decide to attend the bootcamp later, we'll credit the amount you spend on Website in a Weekend towards the bootcamp tuition.&nbsp;

**4\. What kind of support is provided?&nbsp;**

We have a private facebook community that is monitored by our experienced mentors where we can help answer your questions and provide technical support.

If you would like one-on-one skype access to our experienced mentors, we can provide packs of 4 hours of support for only $100 (one-on-one support from an experienced developer is normally at least $60 per hour).&nbsp;

**5\. What if I'm not satisfied with the course?&nbsp;**

We believe whole heartedly in our so far have a 100% satisfaction from everyone who has completed the course. &nbsp;Contact us within two weeks of purchase and explain how the program did not meet your expectations for a full refund.&nbsp;

## Our Hybrid Bootcamp in Bali

Looking to take things to the next level? Our [hybrid bootcamp](http://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev){: target="_blank"} (6 weeks part time online + 10 day intensive in Bali + lifetime support) might be exactly what you need.&nbsp;

This program goes well beyond the basics and teaches you how to build a freelance career as a web developer (or land a job at an agency if that's more your thing).&nbsp;

**A few highlights in the curriculum:&nbsp;**<br>\- learning how to use jQuery (a library for Javascript) to add interactive elements like pop-up lightbox galleries, sliders / carousels, hamburger mobile menus etc.&nbsp;<br>\- how to create dynamic layouts for things like blog posts or project pages<br>\- how to create smooth animations on hover and other transitions&nbsp;<br>\- how to add live chat widget<br>\- how to add custom contact forms that sync with a CRM like Hubspot<br>\- how to create advanced layouts with overlapping elements (like the IOC website)<br>\- how to optimise your website for performance in every browser and on mobile devices&nbsp;

Check out our [course page](http://www.instituteofcode.com/courses/web-dev){: target="_blank"} for all the details and examples of student projects\!&nbsp;<br><br>The main difference though between an online course and in-person immersive is in the practical experience – it's one thing to understand the theory of specific properties; It's another thing completely to build an entire website from scratch. We focus in the bootcamp on taking the skills you have learnt in the video modules and applying them, building things and breaking things, learning how to troubleshoot and write efficient code. So that by the time you finish the program you can confidently build website for yourself or clients, from start to finish.&nbsp;
