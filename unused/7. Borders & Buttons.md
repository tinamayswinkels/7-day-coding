As a refresher, the syntax for css is to have a selector that tells the browser which elements to apply these styles to, a property, and a value.

```css
selector { property: value; }
```

### Adding a background color or image

The **background** property styles the background of any element, such as a paragraph, link, section or body. You can set a background-image, or a background-color.

Eg. This sets the background of all links to a shade of blue

```css
a {background-color: #3498db;}
```

Eg. This will set the background image to an image called background which is stored in the main folder of your website.

```css
body {background-image: url('/background.jpg');}
```

The **background-color** property sets the background color; it can be a color name, #hex, or rgba. For rgba each number represents (red, green, blue, alpha-transparency). RGB ranges from all 0 for black and all 255 for white. Alpha-transparency is a decimal number from 0-1, where 1 is solid and 0 is transparent. Note the US spelling of color.

For some color inspiration see [http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/](http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/) which lists the HEX and RGB values.

### Borders

The **border** property adds a border around the elements in question, and to do so you set a border width, style, and color in one property – `{border: width style color;}`&nbsp;Style values can include solid, dashed, dotted etc. You need all three parts to make a border work

Eg. This sets a purple 1px wide border around everything with a class of button in a solid style.

```css
.button { border: 1px solid purple; }
```

The **border-radius** property curves the corners of an element. A 3px border radius means the borders are curved 3px from the edge – the higher the number, the rounder the corner. You can use pixels or percentages for border radius, and if you set the value to at least 50% a square will become a circle (a rectangle will become an oval).

Eg. This sets the corners of the buttons (and thus it's border or background color) to be rounded.

```css
.button { border-radius: 5px; }
```

### Properties to add space around elements

To add space around an element we use the **margin** and **padding** properties – both add space around an element, but **padding adds space within an elements border** and background color, and **margin adds space outside of it's border**.

Eg. This adds 10% padding within the element and 5% margin outside of the element with a teal background color so that you can see the difference.

```css
body {
  background-color: #1abc9c;
  padding: 10%;
  margin: 5%;
}
```

In this example, we have a h1 element that says hello world. The space between the element and it's border (in yellow) is padding, while the space outside of the pink border is the margin.

This would be styled something like this:

<div class="cp_embed_wrapper"><iframe id="cp_embed_aVLKYG" src="//codepen.io/instituteofcode/embed/aVLKYG?height=206&amp;theme-id=light&amp;slug-hash=aVLKYG&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=instituteofcode&amp;embed-version=2&amp;pen-title=aVLKYG" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" height="206" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" name="CodePen Embed" title="aVLKYG" class="cp_embed_iframe " style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden;"></iframe></div>

<script async="" src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

&nbsp;

Another way of thinking of it is that padding is like an elements body fat, it's part of the element, while the margin is personal space around the element.

There are a few different ways to add elements like padding & margin depending on where you want the space to be.

```css
/\* padding on all sides \*/
padding: 10%;

/\* padding on specific sides \*/
padding-left: 10%;
padding-right: 5px;
padding-top: 3%;
padding-bottom: 2%;

/\* vertical (5%) & horizontal (10%) padding \*/
padding: 5% 10%;

/\* padding on specific sides shorthand \*/
/\* moving clockwise - 10px top, 5px right, 3px bottom, 7px left \*/
padding: 10px 5px 3px 7px;
```

### CSS Units

There are also quite a few different measurements that we can use in CSS:

| Unit | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| px | number of screen pixels |
| em | relative to the font-size of an element, if the element had a font size of 12px then 1em would be 12px |
| rem | relative to the font size of the html. Preferrably for accessibility as it enables users to zoom text. If the html is set to 16px then 1rem would be 16px |
| % | Refers to a percentage of it's parent container. Often used for creating layouts |
| vw | % of the viewport (screen) width |
| vh | % of the viewport (screen) height |

**Which units to use:**

* We'll be using **rems** for typography
* For layouts (to control the size of elements or add padding and margin on container elements) we'll typically use **percentages** or **vw / vh**
* We'll set border width in **px** & border-radius in **px** or **percentages**
* For responsive typography that scales with the page (ie you want a big banner text that takes up half the page) we can use **vw**

We won't be using ems, but if you want to learn more about ems vs rems and when they might be useful check out [this comprehensive article](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/comprehensive-guide-when-to-use-em-vs-rem--cms-23984).&nbsp;
